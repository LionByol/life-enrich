Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent binge eating, followed by compensatory behaviors.

Our client, Ms Ma, she didn’t know the reason that she consumed huge quantities of food, like ice-cream, cake, pastry, potato chips…etc. Whenever she was stressed or upset, she binged. She did not want to suffer from bulimia as she knows that it affects her health. She came to our centre a few times to have the hypnotherapy, and after that, she recovered and she learnt how to manage her emotions, she built up her self-confidence and she can enjoy her life now!
