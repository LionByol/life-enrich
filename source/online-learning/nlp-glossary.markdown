#Accessing cues

Accessing cues or Eye accessing cues or Eye Movements, it is the strategy identified by Richard Bandler and John Grinder.

It is believed that when eye moves in a specific direction, it often seems to link with a specific kind of internal or mental processing. There are some common patterns of eye accessing cues:

* Upwards (left/right) -- Visual (V)
* Level (left/right) -- Auditory (A)
* Down-right -- Kinesthetic (K)
* Down-left Auditory internal dialogue (Ad)

#Analogue

Continuously variable between limits, like a dimmer switch for a light. In NLP, it refers to the use of sensory representations when thinking.

#Anchoring

The process by which any stimulus or representation (external or internal) becomes connected to and triggers a response. Anchors can occur naturally, or we can set them up intentionally.

#“As if” frame

Pretending that some event has happened, thinking ‘as if’ it had occurred, encourages creative problem-solving by mentally going beyond apparent obstacles to desired solutions.

#Associated

#Auditory

To do with the sense of hearing.

#Backtracking

Reviewing or summarizing, using another's key words and tonalities.

#Behaviour

Any activity that we engage in, including thought processes.

#Beliefs

The generalizations we make about the world and our operating principles in it.

#Calibration

Accurately recognizing another person's state by reading non-verbal signals.

#Capability

A successful strategy for carrying out a task.


#Chunking (stepping)

Changing your perception by going up or down a logical level. Stepping up means going up to a level that includes what you are studying. Stepping down entails going to a level below for a more specific example of what you are studying. We can do this on the basis of member and class, or part and whole.


#Complex equivalence

#Congruence

State of being unified, and completely sincere, with all aspects of a person working together towards an outcome.


#Conscious

Anything in present-moment awareness.


#Content reframing

Taking a statement and giving it another meaning by focusing on another part of the content, asking: 'What else could this mean?'

#Conversational postulate

Hypnotic form of language; a question interpreted as a command.

#Dissociated

Not in experience; seeing or hearing events from the outside.


#Distortion

The process by which we inaccurately represent something in internal experience in a limiting way.

#Meta

Existing at a different logical level to something else. Derived from the Greek, meaning 'over and beyond'.

#Metaphor

Indirect communication by means of a story or figure of speech implying a comparison. In NLP, metaphor includes similes, parables and allegories.
